Description: A cross platform, self-hosted server compatible with Bitpay API
 BTCPay Server is a free and open-source cryptocurrency payment processor which
 allows you to receive payments in Bitcoin and altcoins directly, with no fees,
 transaction cost or a middleman.
 .
 BTCPay is a non-custodial invoicing system which eliminates the involvement of
 a third-party. Payments with BTCPay go directly to your wallet, which
 increases the privacy and security. Your private keys are never uploaded to the
 server. There is no address re-use, since each invoice generates a new address
 deriving from your xpubkey.
 .
 The software is built in C# and conforms to the invoice API of BitPay. It
 allows for your website to be easily migrated from BitPay and configured as a
 self-hosted payment processor.
