# Project documentation

There are four parts of the documentation:

1. [User-level documentation](user-level.md) - this is all information a user of these packages needs assuming the user doesn't care about details too much
2. [Admin-level documentation](admin-level.md) - the information needed for system administrators who may have specific advanced wishes about configuring the system
3. NOT WRITTEN YET Repository-developer documentation - the information needed for contributors to this project
4. NOT WRITTEN YET Application-developer documentation - information for developers of specific applications that they'd like to integrate into this project

Note that "higher levels" still need to read previous ones! App developers probably don't need to read repository-developer *in depth* - just skim it.

The documentation is work in progress. Feel free to ask things and the answers to good questions will be added to the docs.
