# The experimental repository

There exists an experimental version of this repository containing bleeding-edge updates, sometimes even new packages.
It's intentionally not documented to discourage newbies from using it.
It also uses different keys to prevent attackers from supplying potentially broken packages.
**It can be dangerous to use it - read the next section!**

If you're a developer/tester and want to use it, you can find it if you look hard.
Please do **not** publish it directly and do **not** encourage others to use it.
Doing otherwise may be viewed as attack and will be publicly criticized.
You can also write me a private message and ask for instructions.
I will not hand-over the instructions to random newbies though!

## Consequences of using packages in experimental

* Risk of downtime, including long (bitcoin chain resync)
* Risk of security issues
* Risk of breaking the system in a way that's very difficult to fix
* Risk of various foot-guns, conflicts in packages, weird/confusing bugs

In general the experimental repository is **not and never will be suitable for production use!**
