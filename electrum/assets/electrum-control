 This package contains a launcher configured to make sure you don't leak
 private data to a random Electrum server. It uses your own local server
 (electrs) instead. Apart from privacy benefits, this also validates all
 incoming satoshis, making it impossible to defraud you by feeding you invalid
 blocks.
