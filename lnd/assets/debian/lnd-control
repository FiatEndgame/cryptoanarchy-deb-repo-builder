Description: Lightnning Network Daemon
 The Lightning Network Daemon (lnd) - is a complete implementation of a
 Lightning Network node. lnd has several pluggable back-end chain services
 including btcd (a full-node), bitcoind, and neutrino (a new experimental light
 client). 
 .
 Note that this is just a binary and does nothing unless configured and
 executed. Consider using lnd-system-mainnet to automatically manage the
 daemon using main Bitcoin network.
